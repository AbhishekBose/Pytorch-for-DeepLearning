### PyTorch for Deep Leaning - Autograd ERA video series

In this githu repo, I have posted all the notebooks which I have used in order to create the videos.
The notebooks contain code snippets for the following:

1. Tensors introduction for PyTorch
2. Operations on tensors
3. Dataloaders and datasets in PyTorch
4. Loading a custom Dataset in PyTorch
5. Transfer Learning on custom dataset in Pytorch
